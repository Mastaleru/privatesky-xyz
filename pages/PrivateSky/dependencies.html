    <psk-description>
        PrivateSky project tries to avoid using NPM packages and NPM in general (or any other build system) for the dependencies of the project's core and that is why we have a custom script that helps with the deps.

    <psk-chapter title="Dependencies Management">
        PrivateSky project has a dedicated script that handles dependencies management (install, update etc.)<br>
        The script that handles PrivateSky deps can be found in <b>"bin/scripts/build-devel.js"</b>.
        <psk-code language="bash">
            cd privatesky/bin/scripts
            cat build-devel.js
        </psk-code>
        The role of <b>build-devel.js</b> file is to run a specific configuration when somebody needs to install or update a PrivateSky installation dependencies.
        <psk-chapter title="Adding a dep">
            To add a new dependency in a PrivateSky installation just modify the config JSON object present in <b>build-devel.js</b> accordingly.
            If you need to add a <b>dependency from npm</b> just add something like this in the JSON:
            <psk-code language="json">
                {
                "name": "name_of_npm_dependency",
                "src": "npm",
                "actions": ["install"]
                }
            </psk-code>
            If you need to add a <b>dependency from Github</b>, just add something like this in the JSON:
            <psk-code language="json">
                {
                "name": "name_of_target_folder_dependency",
                "src": "https://github.com/name_of_organization_or_github_user/name_of_github_dependecy.git"
                }
            </psk-code>
        </psk-chapter>
        <psk-chapter title="Removing a dep">
            If you need to remove a dependency first ensure that there is no usage into the project and only then remove the dep object from JSON config found in <b>build-devel.js</b>.
        </psk-chapter>
    </psk-chapter>
    <psk-chapter title="Install dependencies">
        Once a dependency is added, run <b>npm install</b> or <b>npm run update</b> command according to the project's status.
